This data comes from a recent study of Co3O4: http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.104104
Co3O4 was heated to a given temperature, then cooled quickly (i.e. quenched) to room temperature. The magnetic moment evolves as a function of the quenching temperature.

Samples were quenched from 300K, and 723K to 1173K in 50K intervals.
Data was collected at 1.5K, 100K, and 300K for every sample. (Although a couple files at 100K and 300K are missing)

Neutron diffraction measurements were performed on the two-axis diffractometer D1B at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France). Diffractograms were recorded with a wavelength of lambda=2.52 A, the samples being contained in a vanadium can within a cryostat.

lambda 1 2.520000
lambda 2 1.260000
ratio 0.01000
